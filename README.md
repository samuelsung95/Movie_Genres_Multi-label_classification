# Movie_Genres_Multi-label_classification
CS230 Final Project

Three deep learning models were implemented to classify multi-label movie genres: VGG16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-169. DenseNet-169 yielded the highest score of AUC-ROC, F1, and perfect prediction. We defined perfect prediction as the number of correctly predicted movies in test set divided by the total number of movies in test set. Thus, we can conclude DenseNet-169 is by far the best model to be used to classify multi-lable movie genres. For greater detail, training/evaluation/predicting steps are layed out in the .ipynb notebook for each model
